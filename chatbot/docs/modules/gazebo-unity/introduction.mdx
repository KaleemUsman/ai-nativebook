# Gazebo & Unity Simulation

Welcome to **Module 2: Gazebo & Unity Simulation** - learn to create realistic physics-based simulations and high-fidelity visualizations for humanoid robots.

## Overview

Simulation is critical for safe and efficient robot development. This module covers two powerful simulation environments:

- **Gazebo**: Physics-accurate simulation for control and testing
- **Unity**: High-fidelity rendering for visualization and synthetic data

## What You'll Learn

- **Gazebo Physics**: Accurate physics simulation for humanoid robots
- **Unity Rendering**: Photorealistic visualization and synthetic data generation
- **Sensor Integration**: Simulating cameras, LiDAR, IMU, and force sensors
- **Digital Twin**: Creating synchronized digital replicas of physical robots

## Chapters

| Chapter | Topic | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Gazebo Physics](./gazebo-physics) | Physics engine setup and robot spawning |
| 2 | [Unity Rendering](./unity-rendering) | High-fidelity visualization pipeline |
| 3 | [Sensor Integration](./sensor-integration) | Camera, LiDAR, and sensor simulation |
| 4 | [Digital Twin](./digital-twin) | Real-time synchronization patterns |

## Prerequisites

- ROS 2 Humble installed
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- NVIDIA GPU recommended (for Unity and Gazebo rendering)
- Module 1 completion recommended

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Gazebo
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs

# Install Unity Hub (manual download from unity.com)
# Then install Unity 2022.3 LTS

# Verify Gazebo installation
gazebo --version
```

## Why Two Simulators?

| Feature | Gazebo | Unity |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Physics Accuracy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Visual Fidelity | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| ROS 2 Integration | Native | Via Plugin |
| Synthetic Data | Basic | Advanced |
| Real-time Performance | Good | Excellent |

Using both simulators together gives you the best of both worlds: accurate physics from Gazebo and stunning visuals from Unity.
