# Welcome to the AI-Native Book

We're excited to launch the **AI-Native Book** — your comprehensive guide to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics development.

<!-- truncate -->

## What You'll Learn

This documentation covers four major modules:

### 🤖 Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Master the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the industry-standard middleware for robotics development. Learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions.

### 🎮 Module 2: Gazebo & Unity Simulation
Build realistic simulation environments for testing your humanoid robots before deploying to physical hardware.

### 🧠 Module 3: Isaac AI Brain
Leverage NVIDIA Isaac for advanced perception pipelines, visual SLAM, and Nav2 navigation systems.

### 🗣️ Module 4: Vision-Language-Action
Implement voice-controlled humanoid robots with LLM-based cognitive planning and autonomous behavior.

## Getting Started

Head over to our [Introduction](/docs/intro) to begin your journey into Physical AI development.

Happy building! 🚀
