# ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - your comprehensive guide to building robust humanoid robot applications using the Robot Operating System 2.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the foundation for modern robotics development. This module covers everything you need to know to build production-ready humanoid robot systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Architecture**: Understanding ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Communication**: Message passing and inter-process communication
- **URDF Modeling**: Creating robot descriptions for simulation and control
- **AI Integration**: Connecting ROS 2 with AI/ML pipelines

## Chapters

| Chapter | Topic | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Architecture](./architecture) | ROS 2 core concepts and design patterns |
| 2 | [Communication](./communication) | Topics, services, actions, and parameters |
| 3 | [URDF Modeling](./urdf-modeling) | Robot description and joint configurations |
| 4 | [AI Integration](./ai-integration) | Connecting AI pipelines to ROS 2 |
| 5 | [Summary](./summary) | Best practices and next steps |

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Windows 11 with WSL2
- Python 3.10+ or C++17
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install ROS 2 Humble
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop

# Source the environment
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Verify installation
ros2 --version
```

## Key Concepts

### Nodes
Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 applications. Each node is a single-purpose process that communicates with other nodes.

### Topics
Topics provide a publish-subscribe mechanism for streaming data between nodes. Ideal for sensor data and continuous updates.

### Services
Services provide a request-response pattern for synchronous communication. Perfect for discrete operations.

### Actions
Actions extend services with feedback and cancellation capabilities. Essential for long-running tasks like navigation.
