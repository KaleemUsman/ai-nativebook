# Introduction

Welcome to **AI-Native Book + RAG Chatbot** - a comprehensive guide to building humanoid robots with modern AI techniques.

## What You'll Learn

This documentation covers four main modules for humanoid robotics development:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Learn the core concepts of Robot Operating System 2:
- Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
- Launch files and parameter management
- Custom message types
- Best practices for robotics development

### Module 2: Gazebo & Unity Simulation
Create realistic simulations for humanoid robots:
- Gazebo for physics-based simulation
- Unity for high-fidelity visualization
- URDF/SDF robot description
- Sensor simulation and testing

### Module 3: Isaac AI Brain
Implement advanced perception and navigation using NVIDIA Isaac:
- Isaac ROS for accelerated perception
- Object detection and semantic segmentation
- SLAM and localization
- Nav2 navigation stack

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Build voice-controlled humanoid robots with LLM-based cognitive planning:
- OpenAI Whisper for voice recognition
- GPT-4 for action planning
- ROS 2 action execution
- End-to-end autonomous pipelines
